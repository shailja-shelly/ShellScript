1> LILO
LILO is linux loader , It is configured initially for LINUX installation process , During installation it is used to load linux into memory and start the Operating system .
below is the steps of LILO 
  (i) Locating LInux Kernel
  (ii) Identifying other supporting programs and loading them into memory .
  (iii) loading the Linux kernel into main memory

2> GRUB
GRUB is a boot loader , Password protecting GRUB access prevents unauthorized users from entering single user mode and changing settings at boot time. 

3>Single user mode

In Single user mode - multi-user linux system boots into a single user environment with superuser privilege , 
If it is not enforced with password , then it will directly get bash prompt , without entering root password.

If you would like to force a login password prompt even in single user mode, you can add the following to /etc/inittab.

  ~~:S:wait:/sbin/sulogin

4>check syslogd is running
The workhorse of LINUX logging system is the system logging daemon or syslogd ; 
This daemon is normally started from the system startup scripts , almost any part of the system , including applications , drivers , as well as other daemons can make log entries.

5>check authpriv is enabled
authpriv is separate bucket for routing authorization messege to a log file , 
that has more restricted permission that those of auth . Different OS's will send different messege to auth vs. authpriv

6>Check permission of /var/log/secure file
Contains information related to authentication and authorization privileges. For example, sshd logs all the messages here, including unsuccessful login.

7>content of /etc/motd file
The /etc/motd is a file on unix like system , that contains a "messages of the day" , used to send common messeges to all users in a more efficient manner.
The contents of /etc/motd are displaying by the unix login command after a successful login , and just before it executes the login shell.

8>content of /etc/issue file
The file /etc/issue is a text file , which contains a message or system identification to be printed before the login prompt.

9) finger service should be disable in linux , as remote user can get important information about the system by using finger command

10) Differnce between cron and anacron 
  Cron and anacron used for almost same purpose .
  They have same differnce according to configuration and usage
  (i) Minimum granularity with cron is minute , where minimum granularity with nacron is day .
  (ii) cron job can be scheduled by any user , where anacronjob is scheduled only by super user.
  (iii) cron expects to be system up and running every time , where anacron does not expect the system to be up and running every time .
       If a job is scheduled , and that time system is off , then ancron will execute the job as soon as system is up .
  -----crontab configuration file -----
  cat /etc/crontab

11) what is the main system log files 
 /var/log/messages -- This file contains all messages and the script written by the user
 
12) user details are saved in /etc/passwd file in the below format
    e.g - user:password(x):uid:gid:home_path:default_shell 
    ansible:x:1015:1015::/home/ansible:/bin/bash
	password is saved in /etc/passwd as (x) , where password is actually saved in /etc/shadow file as encrypted format
	
	useradd options 
	-c == comment
	-d == home_dir
	-e == expire_date
	-g == groupid
	-s == shell
	
	/etc/passwd : user account information
	/etc/shadow : secure user account information , where password is saved as encrypted format 
	/etc/group : group account information
	/etc/gshadow : secure group account information
	/etc/default/useradd : default values for account creation
	/etc/skel : Directory containing default files
	/etc/login.defs : shadow password 

Special permissions of files :
1)suid :
    suid / setid is a special permission of file , It is represented by s (octal -4 ) .
	this is required , when as a system admin , you dont want to change some system configuration file ,
	in case of /etc/passwd , it is set with suid , so other account can change their password and correspondingly the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow file is updated.
  how to set suid :
    $) chmod u+s check.txt
	  -rwSr--r--. 1 root         root          14 May 17 14:43 check.txt
	$) chmod 4655 check2.txt
	  -rwSr-xr-x. 1 root         root          14 May 17 14:45 check2.txt
	  
2)sgid :
   sgid /setgroup id is also a special type of file permission . It is also represented by s(octal -2 ) .
   If I set sgid on a folder /directory , then the user will get the file group permission for diectory and the subdirectories and files under it .
   how to set sgid :
    $) chmod g+s check
	   drwxr-sr-x. 2 root         root           6 May 17 14:51 check
	   
3)sticky bit :
  sticky bit is also a special type of file permission .It is represented by t (octal -1 )
  If a sticky bit is set on file or directory , then the file / directory can be deleted only by owner of the file , owner of the directory and root .
  This is usefule for publicly accessible directory like /tmp
  how to set sticky bit :
  $) chmod +t /tmp
   ls -ld /tmp/
	drwxrwxrwt 16 root root 4096 Jul 24 23:30 /tmp/

## installation a package with yum
# main configuration file for yum is 
/etc/yum.conf
$) yum install firefox
   (It will ask for confirmation at the end )
$) yum -y install firefox
   (It will automatically accept confirmation)
$) yum remove firefox
   (To remove package using yum)

   (To remove firefox)
   
yum-config-manager (yum config manager is used for adding , enabling and disabling yum repositories )
1) To add repo 
  $) yum-config-manager --add-repo reposiitory url (It will save the .repo file under /etc/yum.repos.d directory
  e.g -
	yum-config-manager --add-repo http://www.example.com/example.repo
	Loaded plugins: product-id, refresh-packagekit, subscription-manager
	adding repo from: http://www.example.com/example.repo
	grabbing file http://www.example.com/example.repo to /etc/yum.repos.d/example.repo
	example.repo                                             |  413 B     00:00
	repo saved to /etc/yum.repos.d/example.repo

2) To enable repo 
  yum-config-manager --enable repository
 e.g.
   yum-config-manager --enable example\*
   Loaded plugins: product-id, refresh-packagekit, subscription-manager
	============================== repo: example ==============================
	[example]
	bandwidth = 0
	base_persistdir = /var/lib/yum/repos/x86_64/6Server
	baseurl = http://www.example.com/repo/6Server/x86_64/
	cache = 0
	cachedir = /var/cache/yum/x86_64/6Server/example
	[output truncated] 
 
3) To disable repo
  yum-config-manager --disable repository

  yum list postgresql*

installation package using yum

For listing all available version
