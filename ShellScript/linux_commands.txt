1) ps aux
   a = show processes for all users
   u = display the process user / owner
   x = also show processes not attach to a terminal
2) find differnt option
   -type f ---> file
   -type d ----> directory
   -user   ----> user
   -group -----> group
   -perm  ----> permission
   -mtime +<n> ---> modified time greater than the number
   -mtime -<n>  ---> modified time less than the number
   -atime +<n> ---> access time greter than the number
   -atime -<n>  ---> access time less than the number
   -size --> for files
   -exec --> exec option execute the command on find files

3) grep options 
  grep -w --> for word only
  grep -A <n> "string" filename  --> print the matched line along with nth line after it
  grep -B <n> "string" filename  --> print the specified n line berore the match along with the matched line

4) grep -r "string" *
  It will find the string pattern in current directory nd its sub directories recursively

5) grep -v "pattern" filename
6) egrep - extended grep , It operates first , egrep works on regex pattern only

  $) sed 'nd' filename
  To delete the first line
  $) sed '1d' filename
  To delete the last line
  $) sed '$d' filename

8)sort 
-u == for uniqly sort
-n == numeric sort ( default increasing order )
-r == sort on reverse order ( decreasing order )

9)To list all top 10 processes on the basis of cpu utilization
ps -aux | sed '1d' | sort -nr -k3 | head -10
