3) service models in AWS 
 (i) IAAS : Infrustructure as a service
    provding virtualized computing resources over the internet
	dont have any control over underlying hardware
	It is a abstarction over underlying hardware
 (ii) SAAS: Software as a service
  It lease the application / software , which will be available to the client as a software .
  here , we dont have any knowledge about the underlying infrustructure (os,storage etc)
  and hardware 
 (iii) PAAS: Platform as a service 
   In PAAS , it provides virtualized infrastructure as well (os , storage ) . 
   It just gives a run time environment , according to your needs .
   suppose you needs to run your java application , then it gives java runtime environment,
   If you want to run nodejs runtime environment , then it gives nodejs runtime environment .
   e.g. -- AWS ElasticBeanstalk
